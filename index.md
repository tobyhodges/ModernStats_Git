## Project Introduction
Git for Official Statistics is part of the UNECE HLG-MOS ModernStats Carpentries project. This is one out of a series of lessons that have been modified from Software Carpentries to meet the needs of organizations producing official statistics as they upskill their workforces.

Git for official statistics is intended for beginners to novices. This lesson is designed to introduce the basics of using Git while working with others. Additionally, this lesson covers best practices for using Git in the context of official statistics. 

There are plans to translate this lesson into French following the completion of the content in English. Official statistics organizations and community members are welcome and encouraged to translate the contents of the lesson into additional languages to meet their needs. 

If you are interested in running a session, please feel free to contact the owners on the project through the [repository for this lesson](https://github.com/UNECE/ModernStats_Git)
